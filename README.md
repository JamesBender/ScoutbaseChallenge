# What is this?

This is a code sample I created for a position I was applying for. Utlimatley, the position was a bit more "junior" than the desription indicated, and we were unable to come to an employment agreement that worked for both sides.

Please note that there were certain constratins to this exercise that I was required to conform to, and in some cases I feel a better solution could have been provided had I been allowed to deviate from those constraints. If time allows, I will refactor this application to more in-line with what I would build if the design/tooling was up to me.

Thanks for reading!
